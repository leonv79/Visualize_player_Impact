Use Statistics methods to identify the most impactful categories in the PBP stats library

Most notably we use a non parametric method, and the on off stats of the PBP library to identify which categories a player affects the most. 

In this project, I wanted to check for the 2023-24 season the individual impact a player has on others. 

The reason for this was to see which of the main free-agent moves really impacted their teams, and how can they help their new teams.

My first target for this project was Paul Geogre move to Philly. Main target there was to see what Clippers are losing.
